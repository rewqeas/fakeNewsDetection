He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency. It s a badly scripted reality TV show.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.\",\n          \"Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day message to rebuke Donald Trump without even mentioning his name. The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.\",\n          \"On Friday, it was revealed that former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke, who was being considered for Homeland Security Secretary in Donald Trump s administration, has an email scandal of his own.In January, there was a brief run-in on a plane between Clarke and fellow passenger Dan Black, who he later had detained by the police for no reason whatsoever, except that maybe his feelings were hurt. Clarke messaged the police to stop Black after he deplaned, and now, a search warrant has been executed by the FBI to see the exchanges.Clarke is calling it fake news even though copies of the search warrant are on the Internet.

Those subsidies are expected to be linked to recipients\\u2019 income, a \\u201cmajor improvement\\u201d from a healthcare overhaul bill passed in the House of Representatives that tied them solely to age, Republican Senator Susan Collins said on Wednesday. The Washington Post reported that the bill would also repeal most of the taxes that pay for the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, give states wider latitude to opt out of its regulations and eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a healthcare provider that offers abortion services.  The healthcare bill will be released to the Republican Senate Conference on Thursday morning and posted online, senators said. A vote could come as soon as next week, several senators said. Senate Republicans have been working behind closed doors for weeks on legislation aimed at repealing and replacing major portions of Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama\\u2019s signature healthcare law. Obamacare extended insurance coverage to millions of Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. \\u201cThere is an urgency to get this done because of the continued collapse of the Obama healthcare law,\\u201d Senator John Barrasso, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, told CNN. \\u201cPeople across the country are suffering pain and the pain is getting worse as insurance companies are pulling out.\\u201d Democrats accuse Republicans of sabotaging Obamacare, and say the Republican healthcare bill is aimed at cutting taxes for the wealthy. Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington said in a statement that leaked details of the bill indicated it was \\u201cevery bit as devastating for families\\u2019 bank accounts and healthcare coverage as the disastrous bill that passed in the House.\\u201d President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans campaigned last year on a pledge to replace and repeal Obamacare, which they described as ineffective and government intrusion in a key sector of the economy.          Some Republican senators voiced concern on Wednesday about the rush to consider the major legislation as their party\\u2019s leaders prepare to unveil it. Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said he wanted to read the bill and discuss it with constituents before he votes. \\u201cI\\u2019d find it hard to believe we\\u2019ll have enough time,\\u201d he said, adding that if he did not get enough information, \\u201cI won\\u2019t be voting yes.\\u201d Democrats hoping to block the healthcare measure in the Republican-led Senate need at least two Republicans to defect. The Democrats have criticized the behind-the-scenes meetings, and blocked Senate committees on Wednesday from meeting for over two hours in protest.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, defending the closed-door sessions, has said all Senate Republicans have had a chance to participate in meetings on the bill, and that Democrats are not interested in overhauling Obamacare. Once the plan is unveiled, Senate Republicans will face a skeptical public that thinks the House version would be harmful for low-income Americans and people with pre-existing health conditions, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday.  Trump told a rally in Iowa on Wednesday night that he hoped the Senate would come up with a \\u201creally good\\u201d bill. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been talking about a plan with heart,\\u201d Trump said. He had privately called the House legislation \\u201cmean,\\u201d according to congressional sources. Several weeks of negotiations over the bill have been plagued by tensions between moderates and conservatives. Much of the battle has been over how quickly to phase out the Medicaid expansion that took place under Obamacare. Moderates favored a seven-year phase-out, but the Senate leadership proposed three years starting in 2020. There was also an argument over Medicaid\\u2019s growth rate going forward, with conservatives favoring lowering the growth rate in 2025. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what we\\u2019re told it might be,\\u201d said Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.  Cassidy said senators had also been told the legislation would continue funding cost-sharing subsidies made available to help low-income Americans under Obamacare \\u201cfor a couple of years.\\u201d Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, said she wanted to read an assessment by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on its impact on cost and insurance coverage before making her decision.  \\u201cThe first concern is how many people will lose coverage and what do the demographics of that group look like,\\u201d she said.  An estimated 23 million people could lose their healthcare under a similar plan narrowly passed last month by the Republican-controlled House, according to the CBO. \",\n          \"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contenders Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton joined striking Verizon workers\\u2019 picket lines on Wednesday after Sanders was endorsed by New York City transit workers in his fight for union support that has largely gone to Clinton. Sanders addressed hundreds of striking workers in Brooklyn as \\u201cbrothers and sisters\\u201d and thanked them for their courage in standing up to what he characterized as corporate greed by the mammoth communications company. Employees cheered as Sanders, who was born in Brooklyn, criticized Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) for wanting to take away health benefits, outsource jobs and avoid federal income taxes, calling it \\u201cjust another major American corporation trying to destroy the lives of working Americans.\\u201d \\u201cToday I became a Bernie supporter. Basically just having his presence and knowing that he acknowledges the working class matters,\\u201d said technician Kerryann Reid, 36, who said she has worked for Verizon for 15 years. It was a scene tailor-made for the U.S. senator from Vermont, who has focused on income inequality in his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Sanders is trying to catch up with Clinton, the front-runner, in Tuesday\\u2019s primary in New York, a state both candidates have called home. On Wednesday afternoon, several dozen workers picketing a Verizon store in Manhattan cheered as Clinton arrived to show her support.  \\u201cThis has been going on for months,\\u201d she said of the deadlocked contract talks, adding that the employees needed all the support they could get. Despite Sanders\\u2019 daily championing of the rights of working-class Americans, Clinton has racked up the lion\\u2019s share of support from organized labor, a crucial base for the Democratic Party. Among Democrats and independents who belong to a labor union, 50 percent support Clinton and 36 percent back Sanders, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national poll in March. In comparison, Clinton and Sanders have been about even in the poll among all Democrats and independents. The poll from March 1 to March 31 included 780 people who said they were Democrats or independents and belonged to a labor union. It had a credibility interval of 4 percentage points. Nearly 40,000 Verizon employees went on strike on Wednesday in one of the largest U.S. walkouts in recent years after contract talks hit an impasse. \\u201cYou are standing up not just for justice for Verizon workers, you\\u2019re standing up for millions of Americans ... and you\\u2019re telling corporate America that they cannot have it all,\\u201d Sanders told the striking workers. Verizon Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam accused Sanders of getting the facts wrong and oversimplifying the situation, dismissing the candidate\\u2019s views as \\u201ccontemptible.\\u201d The company has to adapt to competition and technology, but still provides good jobs and benefits to thousands, he said in a statement. Sanders fired back on Twitter at McAdam and General Electric Co (GE.N) Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, who criticized Sanders in an opinion article last week. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want the support of McAdam, Immelt and their friends in the billionaire class,\\u201d Sanders wrote. \\u201cI welcome their contempt.\\u201d While Sanders whipped up the crowd in Brooklyn, Clinton\\u2019s campaign issued a statement criticizing Verizon for wanting to outsource more jobs and urging the company to go back to the bargaining table. \\u201cTo preserve and grow America\\u2019s middle class, we need to protect good wages and benefits, including retirement security,\\u201d Clinton said. \\u201cAnd we should be doing all we can to keep good-paying jobs with real job security in New York.\\u201d Earlier in the day, Sanders announced the endorsement of Transport Workers Union Local 100, representing 42,000 workers in the New York City area.  Clinton, meanwhile, won the backing of a local unit, representing more than 27,000 area workers, of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, one of the unions involved in the Verizon strike. The other union involved in the strike, the Communications Workers of America, has endorsed Sanders for president. Other influential unions that have backed Clinton include the AFSCME, a public employees union with 1.6 million members, and the Service Employees International Union, or SEIU, which has about 2 million members in a variety of professions. In what was widely viewed as a win for Sanders, the AFL-CIO, the country\\u2019s largest labor union federation, in February declined to endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary. Sanders also won his first endorsement from a fellow U.S. senator, Democrat Jeff Merkley of Oregon, on Wednesday, while Clinton was endorsed by New York\\u2019s Daily News, which called her a \\u201csuperprepared warrior realist.\\u201d \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nearly all the U.S. Republican presidential candidates will take the stage at CBS News\\u2019 televised debate on Saturday, with Donald Trump flanked by rivals Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush, the network said. It will be the ninth televised debate for Republican candidates seeking to represent the party in the November presidential election amid a thinning field that once had more than a dozen candidates.  The debate in Greenville, South Carolina, comes as the remaining seven candidates aim to gain momentum heading into the  state\\u2019s primary on Feb. 20. CBS said front-runner Trump will take center stage flanked by Cruz, the U.S. senator from Texas, and Bush, a former governor of Florida, making for a potentially heated event between the three men who have had testy exchanges during the campaign.    Former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore did not meet the network\\u2019s criteria to be included, according to the CBS announcement.

Japan has not had fully fledged aircraft carriers since its World War Two defeat in 1945.  Any refit of the Izumo would be aimed at preparing for a scenario in which runways in Japan had been destroyed by missile attacks, and at bolstering defense around Japan s southwestern islands, where China s maritime activity has increased. Three government sources close to the matter said the Japanese government was keeping in sight the possible future procurement of F-35B fighter jets, which can take off and land vertically, as it looks into the remodeling of the Izumo. The 248-metre (814-feet) Izumo, Japan s largest warship equipped with a flat flight deck, was designed with an eye to hosting F-35B fighters. Its elevator connecting the deck with the hangar can carry the aircraft, the sources said.  Possible refitting measures included adding a curved ramp at the end of the flight deck, improving the deck s heat resistance against jet burners, and reinforcing the ship s air traffic control capability, they said. However, Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera said the government was not taking any concrete steps towards refitting the Izumo.  Regarding our defense posture, we are constantly conducting various examinations. But no concrete examination is under way on the introduction of F-35B or remodeling of Izumo-class destroyers,  Onodera told reporters on Tuesday. The Izumo has a sister ship called the Kaga. Japan has frequently conducted joint drills with U.S. aircraft carriers in recent months to boost deterrence against North Korea.  One of the three government sources called such exercises  a great opportunity to see with our own eyes how the U.S. military operates their aircraft carriers  as Japan looks into the possible conversion of the Izumo into an aircraft carrier. Regional tension has soared since North Korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test in September. Pyongyang said a month later it had successfully tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach all of the U.S. mainland. Japan is also wary of China s long-range missiles, and would like to secure measures to launch fighters from aircraft carriers in case runways operated by U.S. forces in Japan or by Japan s Air Self-Defence Force were destroyed by missiles. Article 9 of Japan s pacifist constitution, if taken literally, bans the maintenance of armed forces. However, Japanese governments have interpreted it to allow a military exclusively for self-defense. Owning an aircraft carrier could raise a question of constitutionality, the sources said, so the government is set to address the issue in its new National Defence Programme Guidelines to be compiled by the end of 2018. \",\n          \"Bravo for Judicial Watch! What would we do without them-they have pushed for the truth on so many things about Benghazi but other things that have happened during the lawless Obama years. Thanks to Judicial Watch for finally getting to the bottom of this!Judicial Watch Docs Reveal Obama Admin KNEW Al Qaeda Terrorists Planned Benghazi 10 Days In Advance (Washington, DC)   Judicial Watch announced today that it obtained more than 100 pages of previously classified  Secret  documents from the Department of Defense (DOD)and the Department of State revealing that DOD almost immediately reported that the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was committed by the al Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood-linked  Brigades of the Captive Omar Abdul Rahman  (BCOAR), and had been planned at least 10 days in advance. Rahman is known as the Blind Sheikh, and is serving life in prison for his involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and other terrorist acts. The new documents also provide the first official confirmation that shows the U.S. government was aware of arms shipments from Benghazi to Syria. The documents also include an August 2012 analysis warning of the rise of ISIS and the predicted failure of the Obama policy of regime change in Syria.The documents were released in response to a court order in accordance with a May 15, 2014, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed against both the DOD and State Department seeking communications between the two agencies and congressional leaders  on matters related to the activities of any agency or department of the U.S. government at the Special Mission Compound and/or classified annex in Benghazi. Spelling and punctuation is duplicated in this release without corrections.A Defense Department document from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), dated September 12, 2012, the day after the Benghazi attack, details that the attack on the compound had been carefully planned by the BOCAR terrorist group  to kill as many Americans as possible.  The document was sent to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Obama White House National Security Council. The heavily redacted Defense Department  information report  says that the attack on the Benghazi facility  was planned and executed by The Brigades of the Captive Omar Abdul Rahman (BCOAR).

Japan has not had fully fledged aircraft carriers since its World War Two defeat in 1945.  Any refit of the Izumo would be aimed at preparing for a scenario in which runways in Japan had been destroyed by missile attacks, and at bolstering defense around Japan s southwestern islands, where China s maritime activity has increased. Three government sources close to the matter said the Japanese government was keeping in sight the possible future procurement of F-35B fighter jets, which can take off and land vertically, as it looks into the remodeling of the Izumo. The 248-metre (814-feet) Izumo, Japan s largest warship equipped with a flat flight deck, was designed with an eye to hosting F-35B fighters. Its elevator connecting the deck with the hangar can carry the aircraft, the sources said.  Possible refitting measures included adding a curved ramp at the end of the flight deck, improving the deck s heat resistance against jet burners, and reinforcing the ship s air traffic control capability, they said. However, Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera said the government was not taking any concrete steps towards refitting the Izumo.  Regarding our defense posture, we are constantly conducting various examinations. But no concrete examination is under way on the introduction of F-35B or remodeling of Izumo-class destroyers,  Onodera told reporters on Tuesday. The Izumo has a sister ship called the Kaga. Japan has frequently conducted joint drills with U.S. aircraft carriers in recent months to boost deterrence against North Korea.  One of the three government sources called such exercises  a great opportunity to see with our own eyes how the U.S. military operates their aircraft carriers  as Japan looks into the possible conversion of the Izumo into an aircraft carrier. Regional tension has soared since North Korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test in September. Pyongyang said a month later it had successfully tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach all of the U.S. mainland. Japan is also wary of China s long-range missiles, and would like to secure measures to launch fighters from aircraft carriers in case runways operated by U.S. forces in Japan or by Japan s Air Self-Defence Force were destroyed by missiles. Article 9 of Japan s pacifist constitution, if taken literally, bans the maintenance of armed forces. However, Japanese governments have interpreted it to allow a military exclusively for self-defense. Owning an aircraft carrier could raise a question of constitutionality, the sources said, so the government is set to address the issue in its new National Defence Programme Guidelines to be compiled by the end of 2018. \",\n          \"Bravo for Judicial Watch! What would we do without them-they have pushed for the truth on so many things about Benghazi but other things that have happened during the lawless Obama years. Thanks to Judicial Watch for finally getting to the bottom of this!Judicial Watch Docs Reveal Obama Admin KNEW Al Qaeda Terrorists Planned Benghazi 10 Days In Advance (Washington, DC)   Judicial Watch announced today that it obtained more than 100 pages of previously classified  Secret  documents from the Department of Defense (DOD)and the Department of State revealing that DOD almost immediately reported that the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was committed by the al Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood-linked  Brigades of the Captive Omar Abdul Rahman  (BCOAR), and had been planned at least 10 days in advance. Rahman is known as the Blind Sheikh, and is serving life in prison for his involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and other terrorist acts. The new documents also provide the first official confirmation that shows the U.S. government was aware of arms shipments from Benghazi to Syria. The documents also include an August 2012 analysis warning of the rise of ISIS and the predicted failure of the Obama policy of regime change in Syria.The documents were released in response to a court order in accordance with a May 15, 2014, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed against both the DOD and State Department seeking communications between the two agencies and congressional leaders  on matters related to the activities of any agency or department of the U.S. government at the Special Mission Compound and/or classified annex in Benghazi. Spelling and punctuation is duplicated in this release without corrections.A Defense Department document from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), dated September 12, 2012, the day after the Benghazi attack, details that the attack on the compound had been carefully planned by the BOCAR terrorist group  to kill as many Americans as possible.  The document was sent to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Obama White House National Security Council. The heavily redacted Defense Department  information report  says that the attack on the Benghazi facility  was planned and executed by The Brigades of the Captive Omar Abdul Rahman (BCOAR).

pacific rim trade pact  between president barack obama  who backs the deal  and opponents whose help is crucial to her white house bid  a showdown over trade is expected on friday and saturday when democratic officials meet in orlando  florida  to negotiate language for the party s  platform  which sets policy priorities intended to guide campaign messages in the nov  8 election  different factions of the party are deadlocked over platform language on the sweeping trans pacific partnership  which obama hopes to push through the u s  congress later this year  the current draft  which will be ratified at the july   democratic convention in philadelphia  acknowledges  a diversity of views  over the tpp  while the platform is not binding for candidates  it is a symbol of a party s core values  labor unions and other tpp critics have called for a clear condemnation of the pact  which they fear could lead to steep u s  job losses in manufacturing  but some democrats say that would risk undercutting obama  u s  representative luis gutierrez of illinois  a clinton appointee to the platform committee  told the washington post that while he had a long history of opposing trade pacts  he did not want democrats on the other side of the issue to think they are not important  gutierrez also said he thought  disregarding the position of the president of the united states  was not right  the intra party rift has created a quandary for clinton  the democrats  presumptive nominee  she has staked out opposition to the tpp during her campaign after supporting it while she was secretary of state in the obama administration  presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump has accused her of waffling on trade  trump has strongly condemned the deal  calling it  horrible   if clinton embraces platform language condemning the tpp  it would please unions while causing difficulties for obama  one of her most enthusiastic supporters  moreover  if the platform committee cannot come up with language that satisfies bernie sanders  the u s  senator from vermont who had also sought the nomination and still wields considerable clout  the fight might drag into the philadelphia convention and create a messy spectacle where democrats will formally nominate clinton for the white house  labor unions told the clinton campaign of their frustrations in a closed door meeting on june   one of a series of occasional sessions to update unions supporting her on campaign staffing  logistics and other issues  it concluded with a brief question and answer session where afl cio president richard trumka asked about the pact   the  platform s  language now is unacceptable   hasan solomon  the legislative director of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers  told reuters  the machinists were the first industrial union to endorse clinton and remain strong backers of her candidacy  union activists aligned with sanders were even more blunt   when i saw the language  my reaction was   what are they thinking    said rafael navar  national political director for the communications workers of america  which endorsed sanders   the only way to challenge trump s appeal to millions of working class voters in critical swing states is to be  percent crystal clear on opposing tpp and other job killing trade deals   many union activists also voiced their opposition to the deal to paul booth  executive assistant to the president of the american federation of state  county   municipal employees  at a private june 1 meeting hosted by the afl cio  booth is among the platform drafting committee members suggested by clinton  to push for changes to the tpp platform language  sanders has encouraged his millions of supporters in emails and texts to register their dissatisfaction  but obama s support for the deal makes it hard for the party to come out against it too forcefully  said jamal simmons  a democratic political consultant with the raben group   meanwhile  the platform committee expects more amendments to be offered in orlando    the point of this process   said committee spokeswoman dana vickers shelley   is to hear what people s concerns are   \",\n          \" reuters    since announcing her presidential bid last year  hillary clinton has had to field questions about the bill  hillary   chelsea clinton foundation  her family s global philanthropy   the non profit group has been praised by health experts for helping to negotiate lower prices for hiv medicine in the developing world  but ethics experts and clinton s republican opponents say its reliance on millions of dollars from foreign governments and powerful businesses makes her vulnerable to charges her donors could expect favorable treatment from the white house  which her campaign says is unfounded    the foundation s historybill clinton established the clinton foundation in  to raise funds for his presidential archive in little rock  arkansas  as he prepared to leave the white house  it has since grown into a complex global philanthropic organization  working to improve health and prospects in dozens of countries and to fight climate change  after leaving her job as u s  secretary the state in   hillary clinton joined the foundation s board  and the organization was renamed the bill  hillary   chelsea clinton foundation   later in   hillary clinton left the foundation to run for president and in the august  her husband said he will step down from the board if she wins  their plans to remain with the foundation   the foundation s work the foundation typically raises more than a quarter of a billion dollars each year in grants and donations  it spends about   million each year on programs and other expenses  the biggest program is the clinton health access initiative  which accounts for about two thirds of the foundation s annual expenses and focuses on reducing the cost and increasing the availability of medicine for hiv  malaria and other infections in developing countries   the foundation also is involved in an array of other causes  it helps farmers in africa increase yields and profits and tries to stop poachers from killing elephants there  it encourages american parents to read to their toddlers and schools to provide healthier environments for their students  it also helps americans get access to loans to make their homes more energy efficient  under the name clinton global initiative  the foundation throws regular glitzy multi day gatherings where people from politics  corporations and non profit organizations to discuss philanthropy projects  cgi will hold its last such meeting in september before ending  in   foundation officials admitted the charity breached an ethics agreement clinton signed with the white house in order to become secretary of state  under the agreement  she promised she would annually disclose the names of all donors to the charity and that it would seek state department approval before accepting new money from foreign governments  the charities said not complying with the promises was a result of oversights  the foundation also admitted it had wrongly completed half a dozen annual tax returns that gave misleading figures about the amount of support it got from foreign governments  among other errors  after reuters discovered the errors  the foundation apologized and refiled the returns  the foundation continued to accept money from foreigners  including foreign governments  and corporations while clinton was secretary of state but has said it will introduce at least some limits on such donations if she becomes president   emails by clinton and her staff released by the state department show it was not unusual for foundation officials to help donors get access to clinton  prompting experts in government ethics to raise concerns that the foundation gives rise to an appearance of a conflict of interest  donald trump  clinton s republican rival for the presidency  has called for a special prosecutor to look into the foundation  clinton s campaign says any donor who expected special favors from clinton in return
